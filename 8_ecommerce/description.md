# Task 12 — E-commerce Store

**Real-world analogues:** Amazon, Shopify storefronts, Etsy
**Figma source:** Online Shopping Website / eCommerce Store UI Kit (community)
**Brand in mockup:** *FASCO* — a fashion / apparel boutique
**Pages:** 7

## Overview

A fashion-focused storefront with the canonical e-commerce flow: browse → product detail → cart → checkout, plus account-creation pages. The mockup uses an editorial black-on-white palette with serif logo (FASCO), generous whitespace, and large lifestyle photography. Layouts are vertically scrollable single columns on the marketing pages and use a left-filter / right-grid split on the shop page.

The task tests classic e-commerce mechanics: product cards with hover/swatch states, faceted filtering, variant selection, cart math (subtotal/shipping/total), discount codes, and a multi-step checkout (contact → delivery → payment).
