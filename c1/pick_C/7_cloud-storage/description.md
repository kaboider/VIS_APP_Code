# Task 11 — Cloud File Storage (with Admin Panel)

**Real-world analogues:** Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box
**Figma source:** Deupload — SaaS Cloud Storage Landing Pages (community)
**Brand in mockup:** *Deupload* — a SaaS cloud-storage product with a creator-facing app and an admin/back-office panel
**Pages:** 33 (3 unauth + 5 file-browser views + 10 user-account/profile sub-pages + 15 admin-panel sub-pages)

## Overview

This is a *full-stack* cloud storage SaaS that combines:
1. **Front-end app** for end-users — browse files, view photos, manage folders, watch transfers, edit account settings.
2. **Admin / back-office panel** — operate the SaaS itself (analytics, content/CMS pages, languages, users, subscription plans, transactions, payment gateways, environment).

The mockup uses a violet/cyan palette, white surfaces, light grey backgrounds, and a thin left icon-rail of major sections. Within Profile and Admin, an *expanded* secondary sidebar shows the named sub-pages. A two-pane layout (sidebar + main) is reused across most authenticated screens, and a right detail rail appears on file-browser views.

The task tests a complex full-stack app with two-role authorization (regular user vs admin), multi-view file browsing (list/grid/photos/folder-tree), uploads with progress, a subscription/billing engine, third-party integrations (social login, AdSense, Stripe/PayPal/Paystack), CMS pages, and i18n.
