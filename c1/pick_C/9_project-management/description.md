# Task 13 — Project Management Tool

**Real-world analogues:** Linear, Asana, Jira, ClickUp
**Figma source:** Project Management System Full Figma Design — Admin & User Dashboard (community)
**Brand in mockup:** *AProjectO* — a team project-management SaaS
**Pages:** 10 (1 unauth + 9 dashboard routes/views, several sharing the same shell)

## Overview

A team project-management SaaS for tracking projects, tasks, and individual performance. After login the user lands in a dashboard shell with a left icon-rail navigation (Project, Tasks, Work Logs, Performance, Settings) and a top utility bar (search, notifications, current user). Most pages live inside this shell; many of them are different views of the same underlying data (projects, tasks, work log) — list view, kanban view, detail drawer, popup, etc.

The mockup uses a soft pastel-blue background, white cards, sans-serif type, and accent colors from a small palette (red/orange/blue/green for status). The task tests the architectural challenge of rendering one normalized data set across many views (list, board, detail, charts) and supporting cross-cutting concerns like search, status filters, and time tracking.
