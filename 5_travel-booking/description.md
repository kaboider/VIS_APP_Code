# Task 8 — Travel / Tour Booking Site

**Real-world analogues:** Booking.com, Expedia, Klook, GetYourGuide
**Figma source:** Travel & Tour Booking Website (community)
**Brand in mockup:** *Travel* — a tour-package booking platform with airline logos
**Pages:** 8 (5 unique routes; 3 are tabs of the package detail page)

## Overview

A tour-package booking site. The main user flow is: search packages from the homepage → browse the package archive → open a package detail page → step through tabs (Information, Tour Plan, Location, Gallery) → fill the "Book This Tour" sidebar to create a reservation. Auxiliary pages: a "Build Your Own Package" custom-trip wizard and an About Us / brand page.

The mockup uses orange and navy on a white canvas with cinematic landscape hero images, script-style display headings ("Travel With Us", "Landscapes"), and partner-airline logos (Emirates, Trivago, Airbnb, Turkish Airlines, Swiss). The Package Detail page uses tabbed navigation so four of the eight pages share one URL with different active tabs.
