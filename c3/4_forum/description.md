# Task 7 — Forum / Q&A Site

**Real-world analogues:** Reddit, Stack Overflow, Hacker News
**Figma source:** Forum Concept for Alem.school (community)
**Brand in mockup:** *alemhelp* — a coding Q&A platform for a programming school
**Pages:** 5

## Overview

A Stack Overflow–style Q&A forum with question feed, threaded answers, voting, tags, search, and per-user navigation. The mockup uses an orange/white palette, sans-serif typography, and a three-column dashboard layout (left nav · main feed · right "must-read" rail) for all signed-in screens. Two unauthenticated screens (Register, Login) use a split-screen design with form on the left and a hero photo on the right.

The task tests classic forum mechanics: nested/threaded comments, voting, tag-based filtering, hot/top/new ranking tabs, and a personal-navigator (your questions/answers/likes).

## Pages

### 1. Register
- **Figma node:** `1-494`
- **Reference snapshot:** `pages/01_Register.png`
- **Structure JSON:** `pages/01_Register_structure-only.json`
- **Description:** Split-screen authentication page. Top header shows the *alemhelp* logo on the left and orange "Register"/blue "Login" buttons on the right. The left column contains a "Join Alem Community" sign-up form with four stacked text inputs — a username field <username>, an email input, a password input <passwd>, and a repeat-password input — inline validation icons (green check for username, red error for email "Email already registered!"), and a peach-tinted "REGISTER" submit CTA <register>. The right column is a full-bleed photo of four friends backlit by sunset.

### 2. Login
- **Figma node:** `1-475`
- **Reference snapshot:** `pages/02_Login.png`
- **Structure JSON:** `pages/02_Login_structure-only.json`
- **Description:** Same split-screen layout as Register, but the left form is shorter — heading "We've Missed You!" with subtext "More than 150 questions are waiting for your wise suggestions!", then a username field <username> and a password field (password shows masked dots with a "Wrong password" error message), and a solid orange "Login" button <login>. The right column is a hero photo of a laptop displaying source code on a desk.

### 3. Main (Questions feed)
- **Figma node:** `1-276`
- **Reference snapshot:** `pages/03_Main.png`
- **Structure JSON:** `pages/03_Main_structure-only.json`
- **Description:** Authenticated dashboard. Top bar holds the logo, the page title "Questions", an orange "Ask a question" CTA, a notification bell with a blue dot, and a user avatar with a dropdown caret <profile>. Three-column body: **left sidebar** with a Search nav item <search>, MENU section (Questions highlighted in orange, Tags, Ranking), PERSONAL NAVIGATOR section (Your questions, Your answers, Your likes & votes <likes>), and small social icons at the bottom; **center column** with pill-style filter tabs (New active, Top, Hot, Closed) above a vertical list of question cards <card>, each card containing the asker's avatar/handle/timestamp, a bold question title, two lines of preview text, colored tag chips, and right-aligned counters for views, comments, and upvotes; **right rail** with two cards — "Must-read posts" (links to platform rules and vision) and "Featured links" (external resources).

### 4. Post View (Open Question)
- **Figma node:** `1-333`
- **Reference snapshot:** `pages/04_Post_View.png`
- **Structure JSON:** `pages/04_Post_View_structure-only.json`
- **Description:** Single-thread view at the route "Open Question". Same three-column shell. Top bar still includes the user avatar with dropdown caret <profile>. The left sidebar reuses the same nav, with a Search item <search> at the top and a "Your likes & votes" entry <like> in the personal navigator. Center column shows the question card with author handle, title "How to patch KDE on FreeBSD?", a syntax-highlighted code block, tag chips, and a blue "Save" button. Below it is a "Suggestions" section: a composer with a text input and an orange "Suggest" button <suggest>, followed by a vertical thread of answer cards — each with the responder's avatar, handle, body text, optional inline quoted code, and footer actions (upvote count, hide/reply links). The right rail in this view replaces "Must-read posts" with a profile card for the question's author (avatar, handle, reputation badge "125 | 6", social icons).

### 5. Post Edit (New Question)
- **Figma node:** `1-384`
- **Reference snapshot:** `pages/05_Post_Edit.png`
- **Structure JSON:** `pages/05_Post_Edit_structure-only.json`
- **Description:** Composition page at the route "New Question". Same shell. Top bar still includes the user avatar with dropdown caret <profile>. The left sidebar reuses the same nav, with a Search item <search> at the top and a "Your likes & votes" entry <like> in the personal navigator. Center column hosts a single white card with three stacked fields: a "Choose categories" dropdown, a "Type catching attention title" text input, and a tall "Type your question" textarea. The card footer has a blue "Add Image" button on the left and a disabled "Save as draft" button plus an orange "Publish" CTA <publish> on the right. Right rail: the standard Must-read posts + Featured links cards.
