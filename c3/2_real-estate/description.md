# Task 2 — Real Estate Listings

**Real-world analogues:** Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com
**Figma source:** Dreams Estate — Free Real Estate UI Kit (community)
**Brand in mockup:** *Dreams Estate* — a property listings platform (buy + rent + agents)
**Pages:** 14 (covering buy, rent, and agent flows + auth + home)

## Overview

A property marketplace for buying and renting homes plus a directory of agents. The mockup uses a white-and-mint palette with subtle violet/pink accents, a top header with mega-menu nav (Home, Listing, Agent, Agency, Pages, Blog) and "+ Post Property" CTA, and a recurring dark-navy breadcrumb band on every interior page. Listing pages share three layouts (grid, list, grid-with-map) selectable via icon toggles, all backed by the same data plus a left-rail filter. Detail pages add full-width galleries, amenity matrices, video, FAQ, and similar-listings.

The task tests classic marketplace mechanics: faceted filtering, sort, multiple list/map view layouts of one dataset, paginated cards, contact/inquiry forms, agent profiles, and auth.
