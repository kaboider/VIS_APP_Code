# Task: Music Streaming Platform

**Real-world analogues:** Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, SoundCloud
**Figma source:** VioTune — Music Streaming Platform (community)
**Brand in mockup:** *VioTune* — a streaming app with a deep-blue cosmic aesthetic
**Pages:** 13 (4 onboarding/auth + 4 player & catalog + 1 subscription + 4 settings tabs)

## Overview

A music streaming platform with onboarding splash, login/signup, a Spotify-style home dashboard, playlist views, a now-playing player, premium subscription tiers, and a multi-tab Settings area. The mockup uses a navy/black palette with violet-blue accents, glowing radial gradients, deep-space backdrops, and a thin left icon-rail nav (Home, Heart, Library, Profile, plus support icons at the bottom). A persistent now-playing mini-player sits above the footer on most authenticated pages, and the recurring "VioTune — Welcome to VioTune!" footer with three link columns (Main Links, Categories, Main Links) and an email subscribe form anchors the bottom.

The task tests media playback state (play/pause, skip, scrub, volume), library browsing, playlist data, premium subscription tiers, and a settings hub with separate forms per tab.

## Bootstrap — from scratch

**Hard rule: build this project from scratch. Hand-write `package.json`, every config file, and every line of application code yourself. NO scaffold, NO starter template, NO `npx create-*` / `npm create *` / `git clone <starter>`. Pick any framework you like, but bootstrap it manually.**
